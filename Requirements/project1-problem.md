# Predefined Project Statement for Project1

Real-World Scenario:
You are a DevOps engineer at EasyPay, and your company is developing an online platform where users add money to their wallet accounts and do online shopping.

EasyPay is a popular payment application, but the company is facing an issue in its payment success rate. The timeout that occurs with the connectivity of the database server has several downtime instances at irregular intervals.

Youâ€™re supposed to build a DevOps infrastructure for an application to run on the high-availability mode by creating a server on EC2 and implementing the network policies to allow the traffic from the front-end application pod.

Hence the app can be more reliable, fast, and secure for the payment process.
